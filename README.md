# VirtualDesktopHelperThings
Just some stuff I mash together to help manage virtual desktops on Windows

Credits go to MScholtes with their repository here: https://github.com/MScholtes/PSVirtualDesktop where I shamelessly stole the C# code from for the Desktop interface.

I really only do some play stuff around that project, so massive kudos to them. They did all the hard work.
